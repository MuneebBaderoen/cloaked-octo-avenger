Event driven game engine wrapped around Three.js webgl rendering.

Initially looking to easily and quickly push out 2D games.

Whats currently included:
<ul>
	<li>Collision detection and physics from MatterJS</li>
	<li>Input and gesture detection using HammerJS</li>
	<li>MatterJS grid collision subdivision.</li>
</ul>

Functionality we hope to provide next:
<ul>
<li>compositing multiple render layers</li>
<li>More specific collision behaviours</li>
<li>spritesheet animation</li>
<li>menu system and easy HUD, on screen input(ie. on screen joysticks)</li>
<li>occlusion culling</li>
<li>spatial subdivision</li>
<li>render pipeline alterations (shaders and such)</li>
</ul>




Just a fun side project and will build functionality as time allows.
